# WPScan Vulnerability Testbench

A DDEV/docker based environment for exploring and replicating vulnerabilities
in WordPress plugins and themes.

## Up and running

See the [DDEV installation instructions](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/)
for how to install and set up docker and DDEV on your system.

Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone <repo-url> [<test-site-root>]
```

Enter the test site directory and launch it:
```
$ cd <test-site-root>
$ ddev start
$ ddev launch wp-admin/
```

This should open the test site in your web browser, where you can install the
plugin/theme you want to test as normal.

## Why?

When evaluating potential vulnerabilities reported to WPScan, we see a number
of common issues that makes it difficult to verify the reported vulnerability.

Sometimes this is because the environment where the reported originally reproduced
the issue is configured in a specific way. Also we do get a number of reported
issues that does not properly consider the WordPress security model, like
users with Administrator or Editor privileges being allowed to inject HTML
and Javascript in places where it would normally not make sense to do so.

To adress both of these issues, we decided we should try to supply a standardised
environment so that issues can be reproduced reliably and in a known environment.
